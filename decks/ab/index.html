            <li>
              All of these will need an iPhone app, an android app, a responsive web app, and an api
              <small>(And possibly a socket server for real time features)</small>
            </li>

            <li>Worldwide developer population expected to top 25 million by 2020 <a href="http://www.evansdata.com/reports/viewRelease.php?reportID=9" target="_blank"><small>(source)</small></a></li>

            What if technology enabled businesses can <strong>reduce their go-to-market costs and time by 10x</strong>, and still end up with a <strong>10x better product</strong> than what 90% of development teams in the world can build?
