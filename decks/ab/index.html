            <li>More than 100 million businesses are launched anually <a href="http://www.cityam.com/220819/graphic-shows-just-how-many-startups-are-launched-worldwide-every-second" target="_blank"><small>(source)</small></a></li>

            <li>A very good fraction of these are going to be <strong>technology enabled</strong> businesses</li>

            <li>
              All of these will need an iPhone app, an android app, a responsive web app, and an api
              <small>(And possibly a socket server for real time features)</small>
            </li>

            <li>Worldwide developer population expected to top 25 million by 2020 <a href="http://www.evansdata.com/reports/viewRelease.php?reportID=9" target="_blank"><small>(source)</small></a></li>

            What if technology enabled businesses can <strong>reduce their go-to-market costs and time by 10x</strong>, and still end up with a <strong>10x better product</strong> than what 90% of development teams in the world can build?

          <h2>Go-To-Market Plan(1/2)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Develop a world class team in react native by working through <strong>milestone products</strong> like
              <small><ul>
                <li>An app for managing your locations (60% complete, needs a month of work to bring it to market level)</li>
                <li>An app to debate on various topics like football, news etc (timeline : 1-2 months)</li>
                <li>
                  A form builder app to eliminate paperwork and data curation from data collection and survey process
                  (timeline : 2-3 months)
                </li>
                <li>
                  An a/b testing suite for existing native android and iphone apps that works without appstore/playstore updates and using react native (timeline 2-3 months)
                </li>
                <li>
                  High end project work for big companies which require expertise in react native and universal JS (will be done if the company reaches profitability through milestone products, and has extra resources)
                </li>
                <li>In case of No Funding, Bootstrap through projects (2.5xTimelines)</li>
              </ul></small>
            </li>

            <li>
              Develop infrastructure over react native that gets re-used and annealed with each project
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>React Native for android launched in September 2015, so the technology itself is quite new</li>
            <li>Because of React's intelligent design, companies like myntra have already adopted it for their app</li>
            <li>
              As of Nov 2015, All the <strong>milestone products</strong> have weak competitors, and huge market size and/or solid revenue stories.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"The System"</strong> has one serious competitor, <a href="http://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>.
